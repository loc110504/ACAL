61	To prove that the CEO knew of the fraudulent activities occuring, an email he sent his acknowledging his awareness of the conduct.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	No	The email is not hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement being introduced by the CEO himself, and it is being used to prove his awareness of the conduct, which is an exception to the hearsay rule as it is a statement by a party opponent. Since the CEO is a party to the case, his own statements can be used against him without being considered hearsay. This falls under the admission by a party opponent exception.
62	On the issue of whether the defendant knew he was trespassing, the fact that he shook his head when asked by a passing security guard about whether he knew he was on private property.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	Yes	The defendant's shake of the head is a non-verbal statement being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is whether he knew he was trespassing.

65	To prove that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime, a forensics report describing traces of the defendant's DNA that was found by investigators.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	No	The forensics report describing traces of the defendant's DNA is not hearsay because it is not an out-of-court statement introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it is physical evidence collected by investigators, and the report is likely to be considered an expert opinion or a business record, which are exceptions to the hearsay rule. The report's purpose is to establish a factual connection between the defendant and the crime scene, rather than to prove the truth of a statement made by someone else.
66	To prove that the student was a terrible student, the mid-term report written by his teacher.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	Yes	The mid-term report written by the teacher is an out-of-court statement, as it was created outside of the current trial.

No	Not introduced to prove truth	Yes	The statement is an out-of-court declaration made by Philip, and it is being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that Kayla knew she was ill.

No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The statement is being introduced to prove Dylan's ill feeling toward Andrew, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that Andrew is a liar and a hypocrite. This is an example of an exception to the hearsay rule, where the statement is being used to show the speaker's state of mind or emotion. As such, it is not considered hearsay.
81	"On the issue of whether Ann and Austin had a discussion, Ann's statement to Austin, ""I will sell my car to you for a cost."""	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The statement is being introduced to prove that Ann and Austin had a discussion, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. The fact that Ann made the statement is being used to show that a discussion took place, rather than to prove that she will actually sell her car to Austin for a certain cost. This is an example of a statement being used for a purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.

Therefore, it is not considered hearsay.
88	To prove that Amy believed that Karl was an employee of the store, the fact that Amy told Karl that the store needed to refund her because their marketing had been decieving. 	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The statement is not being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is that Karl was an employee of the store.

92	To prove that Arthur and Mary had a conversation, the fact that Arthur told Mary that the weather the following week would be terrible.	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The statement is being introduced to prove that Arthur and Mary had a conversation, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the weather forecast).
