69	On the issue of whether Albert bought a knife, Angela testified that he shook his head when she asked him.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	No	Hearsay involves an out-of-court statement introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, Angela's testimony about Albert's non-verbal response (shaking his head) is not a statement but an observation of his behavior. Therefore, it does not qualify as hearsay.
70	On the issue of Albert's wellbeing after the accident, Angela testified that he gave a thumbs up when asked how he was feeling.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	No	Angela's testimony about Albert's thumbs up is not hearsay because it is not an out-of-court statement being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it is a non-verbal conduct intended as an assertion, which can be considered an exception to the hearsay rule. The thumbs up is a direct observation of Albert's response to how he was feeling, rather than a statement made outside of court.
71	Albert is being sued by Tim for breach of contract. The issue is whether Albert knew at the time signing the contract that he had no intention of following through. Tim's lawyers introduce an email Albert wrote to his friend saying he wasn't planning on honoring the contract with Tim.	Yes	Non-verbal hearsay	Yes	The email Albert wrote to his friend is an out-of-court statement being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, namely that Albert had no intention of honoring the contract.

72	On the issue of whether factory management had underpaid its workers, the fact that workers carried signs during a protest demanding equitable compensation.	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The workers carrying signs during a protest is not an out-of-court statement being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

The signs themselves are not being used to prove the truth of any statement made on them, but rather to show the workers' collective stance and actions.

79	"On the issue of whether Gerald was alive immediately after being attacked by Kathryn, Gerald's statement, ""I was attacked by Kathryn."""	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	Gerald's statement, 'I was attacked by Kathryn,' is not hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement made by the declarant (Gerald) himself, and it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that he was attacked by Kathryn). Additionally, this statement could fall under the 'excited utterance' or 'present sense impression' exceptions to the hearsay rule, as it was made immediately after the event and reflects Gerald's condition at that time.
80	"On issue of Dylan's ill feeling toward Andrew, Dylan's statement, ""Andrew is a liar and a hypocrite."""	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	Dylan's statement, 'Andrew is a liar and a hypocrite,' is not hearsay if it is being used to show Dylan's state of mind or ill feeling toward Andrew, rather than to prove the truth of Andrew being a liar and a hypocrite.

87	"To prove that Daniel was sad upon hearing the news, the fact he exlaimed ""the world was ending"" and ""nothing mattered anymore."""	No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	"Daniel's exclamations ""the world was ending"" and ""nothing mattered anymore"" are his own statements made contemporaneously with his emotional reaction to the news.

No	Not introduced to prove truth	No	The statement in question is not being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted in court but rather to demonstrate the effect on the listener, which is the customer's confusion. The focus is on the customer's belief and actions, not on the truth of the statement itself. Therefore, it does not fall under the hearsay rule.
